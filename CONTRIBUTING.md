## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- GTK 4 and LibAdwaita development libraries
- Flatpak (for Flatpak-related features)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt install python3-gi gir1.2-gtk-4.0 gir1.2-adw-1 flatpak
```

### Run from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Naftaliro/first-steps.git
cd first-steps
./first-steps
```

```

### Building the .deb Package

```bash
./packaging/build-deb.sh
```

The output `.deb` will be in `packaging/deb/`.

## Coding Guidelines

- Use **GTK4 + LibAdwaita** patterns for all UI elements.
- Run system commands via `BasePage.run_privileged()` or `BasePage.run_unprivileged()` to keep the UI responsive.
- Never run blocking operations on the main thread.
- Use `pkexec` for privileged operations; never ask for passwords directly.
- All privileged scripts must be placed in `/tmp/first-steps-*` for the helper validation.
